# VRP_CFRS

This Python code solves a VRP problem using Cluster-First-Route-Second algorithm. Clustering is done using K-Means and Routing is done by solving a tsp to optimality using Gurobi. Networkx is used in Subtour Elimination to find cycles. 

Note that this code is only to demonstrate coding skills. It might not the most efficient way of solving such a problem.
